# Sample Jupyter Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks showcasing how to use the LUSID SDK. You can find a list of the notebooks at [examples/README](examples/README.md).

## Running the Notebooks in Jupyterhub for your LUSID domain

Authentication is handled automatically; see https://support.lusid.com/knowledgebase/article/KA-01829/en-us

## Running the Notebooks locally

You can run the Notebooks locally but you will need to set up authentication using a secrets file:

1. Clone this repository

```
git clone git@github.com:finbourne/sample-notebooks.git
cd sample-notebooks
```

2. Create a `secrets.json` file in the **examples** folder with your LUSID credentials. [See how to assemble these](https://support.lusid.com/knowledgebase/article/KA-01663/).

3. Build the Docker image

```
docker build -t finbourne/lusid-sample-notebooks .
```
Mac users may need to specify the platform.  On a Mac M1 it is:
```
docker build --platform linux/arm64 -t finbourne/lusid-sample-notebooks .
```

4. Run the Docker image / Run from command line

**Windows**
```bash
docker run --rm -it --name fbn-jupyter -v %cd%:/home/jovyan -e FBN_SECRETS_PATH=/home/jovyan/examples/secrets.json -p 8888:8888 finbourne/lusid-sample-notebooks
```
**macOS/linux**
```bash
docker run --rm -it --name fbn-jupyter \
  -v $(pwd):/home/jovyan \
  -e FBN_SECRETS_PATH=/home/jovyan/examples/secrets.json \
  -p 8888:8888 \
  finbourne/lusid-sample-notebooks
```

You will see something similar to the following output:

```text
[I 09:14:44.031 NotebookApp] Writing notebook server cookie secret to /home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/notebook_cookie_secret

[I 09:14:45.231 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).

    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-6-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://e910e1f74c45:8888/?token=<token>
     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=<token>
```

If you chose to run directly from the command line instead of docker you will need to install the dependencies specified in requirements.txt and then run 'jupyter notebook'

5. Click on the link shown in the console to open up JupyterHub in a browser.

6. Open the `examples` folder and open <a href="http://localhost:8888/notebooks/examples/index.ipynb" target="_blank">index.ipynb</a> to see a catalogue of available notebooks.



### Running notebooks that require Luminesce

There are few notebooks that interact with Luminesce and need some extra config.

For these notebooks you will need to run the following code in the intended notebook:
```
import os
from IPython.core.magic import (register_line_cell_magic)
from lusidjam import RefreshingToken
import lumipy as lm

secrets_path = os.getenv("FBN_SECRETS_PATH")

@register_line_cell_magic
def luminesce(line, cell=None):
    query = cell if cell is not None else line

    lm_client = lm.get_client(token=RefreshingToken(), api_secrets_filename=secrets_path)

    df = lm_client.query_and_fetch(query)
            
    return df

# In an interactive session, we need to delete to avoid
# name conflicts for automagic to work on line magics.
del luminesce
```
